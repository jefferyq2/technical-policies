Topic: For OpenSSL-3.2 release, we have relaxed the requirement of "There are no
outstanding untriaged Coverity issues" as there has been an update introduced to
scan.coverity.org on 18-Nov-2023 that has identified 30 potential issues. We
will document this as a known issue. OTC approves 3.2.0 as ready for release.
